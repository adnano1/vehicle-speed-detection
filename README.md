#This repository contains the implementation of a Vehicle Speed Detection system using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system captures video footage of vehicles and accurately determines their speed in real-time. It leverages Python, OpenCV, and YOLOv8 for object detection and tracking, providing a robust solution for traffic monitoring and law enforcement applications.

#Features:

Real-time vehicle detection and tracking
Accurate speed calculation
Easy-to-use interface
Comprehensive documentation and example scripts
Getting Started:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/adnano1/vehicle-speed-detection.git
